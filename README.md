Swift InFlux
===========
The community is creating some incredible analyses and writing about Swift. What I keep asking myself whenever learning and reading about Swift is: how likely is this to change soon?

This document is an attempt to gather the Swift features that are still in flux and likely to change.

### Limitations of current access control design

Swift [added access control](#access-control) in Beta 4, but there are limitations to its design. Entities marked as `internal` (which is the default) are not visible to other build targets, which means that unit tests (which traditionally live in a separate target) can't access them.

> We're aware that our access control design isn't great for unit testing (and this was in the release notes), we're evaluating the situation to see what we can do.
>
> — Chris Lattner
>
> A limitation of the access control system is that unit tests cannot interact with the classes and methods in an application unless they are marked public. This is because the unit test target is not part of the application module.
>
> — Xcode beta 4 release notes

At the moment, one workaround is to mark all tested entities as public, another is to move tests to the same target as the application code. However, the former ruins the benefits of access control and the latter — of code modularization.

### Flow-sensitive optional unwrapping

With this feature, optional types would be implicitly unwrapped in the context of a block checking if an optional has a value, like so:

```swift
let x: Type?

if exists x {
   x.doSomething() // works without ? or !
}
```

> We're definitely aware of the advantages of control-flow sensitive type refinement for optionals (and also for other subtype relationships).  This would be particularly handy in ternary operators, but isn't something on the books for 1.0.  We have several radars requesting that and tracking it for consideration in a future release.

> As you might guess from the name, __conversion is not intended to be a public feature.  It has never been documented, and we are planning to remove it for the final release.  Implicit conversions are a major source of exponential behavior (i.e., major slowdowns) in the type checker, and can lead to extremely surprising results with type inference.

## Changed in Beta 5

### `dynamic` declaration modifier

`dynamic` is a new attribute that can be applied to properties, methods, subscripts and initializers to make all references to them dynamically dispatched (like message passing in Objective-C). This enables KVO, proxying, swizzling and other advanced Cocoa features to work with Swift.

Before Beta 5, classes marked with `@objc` (or inheriting from `NSObject`) got the benefits of `dynamic` "for free", while non-`@objc` classes couldn't access dynamic dispatch at all. Now the two concepts are separate:

> This change also clarifies the `@objc` attribute. Now it only makes a declaration visible to Objective-C (for examples, to `objc_msgSend`), instead of conflating exposure to the Objective-C runtime with guaranteed lack of devirtualization. This is a cleaner conceptual semantic model that enables performance improvements for a wide range of `NSObject` subclasses by allowing the compiler to use more efficient dispatch and access techniques for declarations marked `@objc` (which is usually implicit).
>
> Though the feature is independent of the `@objc` attribute, the implementation still currently relies on Objective-C runtime details, so dynamic currently can only be applied to declarations with `@objc`-compatible types.

Source: [Xcode 6 beta 5 release notes](http://radex.io/xcode6-release-notes/beta5.pdf)


### Mutable optional value types

From Xcode6-Beta5 release notes:

> The optional unwrapping operator x! can now be assigned through. Mutating methods and operators can be applied through it. (16922562)
```swift
var x: Int! = 0
x! = 2
x!++
// Nested dictionaries can now be mutated directly:
var sequences = ["fibonacci": [1, 1, 2, 3, 0]]
sequences["fibonacci"]![4] = 5
sequences["fibonacci"]!.append(8)
```
> The ? chaining operator can also be used to conditionally assign through an optional if it has a ! value:
```swift
sequences["fibonacci"]?.append(0)
sequences["fibonacci"]?[6] = 13
sequences["perfect"]?[0] = 6 // Does nothing because the sequence has no 'perfect' key
```

Previously:

> The issue here is that optional forcing and binding operators (postfix ! and ?) return an immutable rvalue, even when the operand is a mutable lvalue.  This means that you cannot perform mutating operations on the result, which is why optional arrays, dictionaries and other value types are pretty useless right now.
> Unfortunately there isn't a great solution or workaround right now: one approach is to wrap the value in a class and use the optional on the class wrapper:
```
class StringArray {
    var elts : String[]
}
var myArray: StringArray?
```
> We consider this a significant problem and are investigating various solutions to incorporate in a later Beta.

### Nil coalescing operator

A new operator, `??`, has been introduced to help working with optionals. `??` takes an optional as its left operand, and a non-optional value or expression on the right. If the optional has a value, the whole expression evaluates to the value of the optional (the expression on the right is not evaluated). If the optional is `nil`, the right hand side expression is evaluated and passed as the result. You can think of the nil coalescing operator like the short-circuiting `||` operator, but for optionals.

For example:

```swift
var myArray: [Int] = []
print(myArray.first ?? 0) // produces 0, because myArray.first is nil
myArray.append(22)
print(myArray.first ?? 0) // produces 22, the value of myArray.first
```

### Usage of @-sign in front of keywords

Most of the `@-attributes` have been done away with in Xcode Beta 5.

> The `@assignment` attribute has been removed from operator implementations. (16656024)
>
> The `@prefix`, `@infix`, and `@postfix` attributes have been changed to declaration modifiers,
> so they are no longer spelled with an `@` sign (now, `prefix func (...)`). Operator declarations
> have been rearranged from `operator prefix - {}` to `prefix operator - {}` for consistency. (17527000)
>
> The `@class_protocol` attribute has been removed; the new syntax for declaring that only protocol conformance is limited to classes is `'protocol P : class { ... }’`. (17510790)
>
> — Xcode Beta 5 release notes

There were also additional changes:

> The @auto_closure attribute has been renamed to @autoclosure. (16859927)

### Optional Bool is confusing

Since Beta 5, optional values no longer conform to BooleanType (formerly LogicValue) protocol, which means that:

> (...) they may no longer be used in place of boolean expressions (they must be explicitly compared with v != nil).
>
> — Xcode 6 Beta 5 release notes

Sources: [Xcode 6 beta 5 release notes](http://radex.io/xcode6-release-notes/beta5.pdf)

Optionals for types conforming to the `LogicValue` protocol (primarily Bool) can have confusing semantics:

```swift
var foo: Bool? = false
// This will print bar
if foo {
    println("bar")
}
```

> This problem exists with any optional of something that conforms to the LogicValue protocol (e.g. nested optionals, optional of bool, etc).  We consider it serious issue that needs to be fixed for 1.0 and have some ideas, but haven't settled on a solution yet.

> — Chris Lattner

> FWIW, we have a fix for "optional bool confusion" that will be rolling out in the next beta (along with a few other improvements to optional semantics).  Stay tuned.

### Ranges, Intervals, Striding

Following minor changes to ranges [in Beta 3](#range-operators) and [Beta 4](#new-stride-functions), Beta 5 brings a major rework of the entire area:

> The idea of a Range has been split into three separate concepts:
>
> * Ranges, which are Collections of consecutive discrete `ForwardIndexType` values. Ranges are used for slicing and iteration.
> * Intervals over `Comparable` values, which can efficiently check for containment. Intervals are used for pattern matching in switch statements and by the `~=` operator.
> * Striding over `Strideable` values, which are `Comparable` and can be advanced an arbitrary distance in O(1).
>
> Some of the types most commonly used with the range operators `..<` and `...` – for example, `Int` — conform to both Comparable and ForwardIndexType. When used in a context that requires pattern matching (such as a switch case), the range operators create _Intervals_. Otherwise they create _Ranges_. Therefore, in a context without type constraint such as `let x = 3..<10`, the result is a _Range_.
>
> It is considered an error to form a _Range_ whose `endIndex` is not reachable from its `startIndex` by incrementation, or an _Interval_ whose end is less than its start. In these cases, _Interval_ formation always traps and _Range_ formation traps when a violation is detectable, that is, when the indices are `Comparable`.
>
> ```
1> 1...0
fatal error: Can't form Range with end < start
> ```
>
> `Intervals` are represented by two generic types, `HalfOpenInterval<T>`, created by the `..<` operator, and `ClosedInterval<T>`, created by the `...` operator:
> ```
1> 3.14..<12
$R0: HalfOpenInterval<Double> = {
  _start = 3.1400000000000001
  _end = 12
}
2> 22...99.1
$R1: ClosedInterval<Double> = {
  _start = 22
  _end = 99.099999999999994
}
> ```
>
> A _range_ `x..<y` always has `startIndex == x`. Therefore, `x` is the first valid subscript, and this applies even when the `Index` type is `Int`. In other words, the first valid subscript of `5..<10` is 5, not 0. To prevent surprise, it is a compilation error to subscript a range over an Integer type outside a generic context (for example, expressions like `(5..<10)[0]`).
>
> All _Ranges_ are represented by instances of a single generic type, `Range<T>`, whose representation is always half-open (and thus always print in the REPL and Playgrounds as a half-open range). Currently an inclusive range cannot include the last value in a sequence (for example, `4...Int.max` doesn’t work) unless the context requires an _Interval_ (like a case pattern matching specification).

## Changed in Beta 4

### Access control

Beta 4 adds three levels of access control to user-defined entities: `public` (available anywhere), `internal` (available within the target where they're defined) and `private` (available only within the file where they're defined).

> By default, most entities in a source file have internal access. This allows application developers to largely ignore access control while allowing framework developers full control over a framework's API.

It's also possible to define attributes with public getters but private setters using the `private(set)` syntax.

It has been noted that the current access control design [makes unit testing a bit unwieldy](#limitations-of-current-access-control-design).

Source: [Xcode 6 beta 4 release notes](http://radex.io/xcode6-release-notes/beta4.pdf)

### Unicode string improvements

Character was changed in Beta 4 to hold a full grapheme cluster instead of a single code point.

> Certain accented characters (like é) can be represented either as a single code point or as a sequence of two or more code points (e + ́)

Before Beta 4, é achieved using "e" and a combining mark would be treated as two Character instances. Now, every character is a single Character. The change helps avoid a class of bugs when dealing with complex Unicode strings.

In addition to the above, Beta 4 removes `\x`, `\u` and `\U` escape sequences for Unicode characters and replaces them with a single, less error-prone `\u{1234}` syntax

### Numerical data type conversion, e.g. CGFloat and Swift Double/Swift Float

From Beta 4 Release Notes:
>CGFloat is now a distinct floating-point type that wraps either a Float on 32-bit architectures or a Double on 64-bit architectures.

Sources:
[Xcode 6 beta 4 release notes](http://radex.io/xcode6-release-notes/beta4.pdf)

>What is happening here is that CGFloat is a typealias for either Float or Double depending on whether you're building for 32 or 64-bits.  This is exactly how Objective-C works, but is problematic in Swift because Swift doesn't allow implicit conversions.
>
>We're aware of this problem and consider it to be serious: we are evaluating several different solutions right now and will roll one out in a later beta.  As you notice, you can cope with this today by casting to Double.  This is inelegant but effective :-)

> The @final, @lazy, @optional, and @required attributes have been converted to declaration modifiers, specified without an @ sign.

Source: [Xcode 6 beta 4 release notes](http://radex.io/xcode6-release-notes/beta4.pdf)

### New stride() functions

> The .by() method for ranges has been replaced with general stride() functions. To
adopt stride(), use stride(from: to: by:) for exclusive ranges and stride(from: through: by:) for inclusive ranges.

For example, you can now do:

```swift
stride(from: x, to: y, by: z)      // was: (x..<y).by(z)
stride(from: x, through: y, by: z) // was: (x...y).by(z)
```

### `@IBOutlet`

Before Beta 4, marking a property with `@IBOutlet` implicitly made it a weak variable and an implicitly unwrapped optional. Now, the attribute merely makes a property visible to Interface Builder.

Previously:

> In Beta 3 (and earlier) the @IBOutlet attribute implicitly makes the variable weak, and implicitly makes it an implicitly unwrapped optional (unless it's explicitly marked with ?).  We added the 'strong' modifier in Beta 3.
>
> This is super confusing, too magic, leads to problems (like this) where "retains" are lost for types like arrays because the only reference is weak, and isn't even best practice on iOS where most outlets should be strong.  For all of these reasons, in a future Beta, @IBOutlet will become "just" an annotation for IB, without any implicit behavior.

* `CString` was removed. `const char *` values are now imported as `ConstUnsafePointer<Int8>`
* `modulusWithOverflow` was replaced by `remainderWithOverflow`
* `Float` and `Double` no longer conform to `RandomAccessIndex`, which means they can no longer be used to index a collection
* `true` and `false` are now language literals. `Bool` conforms to a new `BooleanLiteralConvertible` protocol that allows user-defined types to support Boolean literals.
* `ArrayBuffer`, `ArrayBufferType`, `SliceBuffer` and `ContiguousArrayBuffer` were removed (the reason being, those structures were only an implementation detail of corresponding types)
* `reverse` is no longer lazy and simply returns an Array. New `lazy` functions can be used to lazily reverse, filter and map collections through new `LazyForwardCollection`, `LazyRandomAccessCollection` and `LazySequence` structures

## Changed in Beta 3

### Array and Dictionary type declaration syntax
Before Beta 3, the shorthand for an Array type was `Type[]`, and Dictionary types were written `Dictionary<KeyType, ValueType>`. Array type shorthand was changed to `[Type]` and Dictionaries types now have a shorthand syntax `[KeyType: ValueType]` (e.g. `[String: Bool]`)

### Array value semantics
Since Beta 3, Array has full value semantics to match Dictionary, String and other value types.

>Array semantics were in flux at the time of Beta 1, and have been revised to provide full value semantics like Dictionary and String.  This will be available in later betas.

### Modifying constant properties in designated vs. convenience initializers

> What is going on here is that initializers have privledged access to 'let' properties while they run: these properties are actually mutable when accessed directly within the initializer.  This is very useful when you're configurating an object during its setup, but it is absolutely required when you have an immutable property dependent on some argument to the initializer, e.g.:
>
```swift
class C {
  let x : Int   // immutable property
  init(input : Int) {
    x = input     // mutating an immutable property!
  }
}
```
> This is an important part of making immutable properties (as opposed to random other immutable variables) useful and functional, but it is dangerous, and potentially allows extensions to a type to violate invariants.
>
> Beta 3 fixes this by only allowing mutation within non-convenience initializers.  Convenience inits must delegate to some other initializer anyway, so that initializer can take an argument and do the mutation.
>
> Long story short, this is a feature, not a bug :-)

### Range operators

The half-open range operator was changed from `..` to `..<`.

> We considered this carefully.  As you can see from this thread, small syntactic issues like this are polarizing, subject to personal preferences, and have no one right answer.  See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikeshed
>
> For what it's worth, this approach is precendented in the groovy language.  It optimizes for readability and clarity: you're unlikely to mistake one operator for the other when skimming code, and new people coming to Swift are unlikely to assume that ..< is an inclusive range operator (like most assumed when they saw "0..5")
