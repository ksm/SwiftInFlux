Swift InFlux
===========
The community is creating some incredible analyses and writing about Swift. What I keep asking myself whenever learning and reading about Swift is: how likely is this to change soon?

This document is an attempt to gather the Swift features that are still in flux and likely to change.

### 2D Array Performance Issues

As of Xcode 6.1 Beta 1, 2D arrays (e.g., `[[Int]]`) are approximately 1000 times slower than 1D arrays (e.g., `[Int]`).

### Limitations of current access control design

Swift [added access control](#access-control) in Xcode 6.0 Beta 4, but there are limitations to its design. Entities marked as `internal` (which is the default) are not visible to other build targets, which means that unit tests (which traditionally live in a separate target) can't access them.

> We're aware that our access control design isn't great for unit testing (and this was in the release notes), we're evaluating the situation to see what we can do.
>
> — Chris Lattner
>
> A limitation of the access control system is that unit tests cannot interact with the classes and methods in an application unless they are marked public. This is because the unit test target is not part of the application module.
>
> — Xcode 6.0 beta 4 release notes

At the moment, one workaround is to mark all tested entities as public, another is to move tests to the same target as the application code. However, the former ruins the benefits of access control and the latter — of code modularization.

### Class variables

At the moment, stored class properties are not supported in Swift. They will come in a later release, but not in 1.0. Possibly, the main reason for this is that Swift largely depends on Objective-C runtime and implementation details, which don't support class variables.

### Flow-sensitive optional unwrapping

With this feature, optional types would be implicitly unwrapped in the context of a block checking if an optional has a value, like so:

```swift
let x: Type?

if exists x {
   x.doSomething() // works without ? or !
}
```

> We're definitely aware of the advantages of control-flow sensitive type refinement for optionals (and also for other subtype relationships).

> A large number of Foundation, UIKit, CoreData, SceneKit, SpriteKit, Metal APIs have been audited for optional conformance, removing a significant number of implicitly unwrapped optionals from their interfaces.

### Overriding declarations from extensions

At the moment, it's not possible to override entities declared in extension by subclassing, like so:

```swift
class Base { }

extension Base {
    var foo: String { return "foo" }
}

class Sub: Base {
    override var foo: String { return "FOO" } // This is an error

We prefer to do this carefully and deliberately over time, rather than attempting to solve all the world's problems at once.

### Enumeration case value labels

Xcode 6.0 Beta 6 [removed the ability](#other-changes-in-xcode-60-beta-6) to label the value of a 1-tuple. Because the associated values of enumeration cases act like a tuple, the following code is now illegal:

```swift
enum SomeEnum {
  case SomeCase(label: SomeValue)
}
```

Confusingly, it's valid to label the associated values if there's more than one. This will be fixed:

> We've found that single-element labeled tuples caused more confusion than they provided benefits, because one sometimes expects that they be equivalent to (or convertible to) the value of their single element type, and other times is surprised by the inter-convertibility between the single element type and a single-element labeled tuple.
>
> As for the enumeration case that started this thread, we're going to bring back support for the label in the single-element case. The user view of the enumeration case is generally function-like, because one calls them like functions, which favors the use of labels.
>
> — Doug Gregor

Also, the ability to specify default values to enum cases might be added:

> That would be a reasonable extension that follows from considering enum cases to be function-like.

## Changed in Xcode 6.1 Beta 1

### Initializers that return nil

Initializers can now fail by returning `nil`. A failable initializer is declared with `init?` to return an 
explicit optional or `init!` to return an implicitly unwrapped optional. For example, you could 
implement `String.toInt` as a failable initializer of `Int` like this:

```swift
extension Int {
  init?(fromString: String) {
    if let i = fromString.toInt() {
      // Initialize 
      self = i 
    } else { 
      // Discard self and return 'nil'. 
      return nil 
    } 
  }
}
```

The result of constructing a value using a failable initializer then becomes optional:

```swift
if let twentytwo = Int(fromString: "22") {
  println("the number is \(twentytwo)”)
} else {
  println("not a number”)
}
```

In the current implementation, `struct` and `enum` initializers can return `nil` at any point inside 
the initializer, but class initializers can only return `nil` after all of the stored properties of the 
object have been initialized and `self.init` or `super.init` has been called. If `self.init` or 
`super.init` is used to delegate to a failable initializer, then the `nil` return is implicitly 
propagated through the current initializer if the called initializer fails.

## Changed in Xcode 6.0 Beta 6

### Refinements to nil coalescing operator

Xcode 6.0 Beta 6 improves on the [nil coalescing operator](#nil-coalescing-operator) introduced last Beta. It's now possible to pass an optional as the righthand side operand — if both sides evaluate to nil, the whole expression evaluates to nil. This makes it possible to chain expressions using nil coalescing, like so:

```swift
let a: Int? = nil
let b: Int? = nil

a ?? b ?? 0
```

In the example above, the first chained expression that doesn't evaluate to `nil` will be used as the value of the entire operation.

Previously, passing a non-optional value as the second operand to `??` was technically valid, but its semantics were [very confusing](http://airspeedvelocity.net/2014/08/12/yo-dawg/)

### Optionals in Foundation

Source: [Xcode 6.0 Beta 6 release notes](http://ksm.github.io/SwiftInFlux/docs/beta6.pdf)

### Boolean semantics of types

Implicitly unwrapped optionals no longer conform to `BooleanType`, which means that they now have to be explicitly compared to `nil` in if statements. (This follows an equivalent change to `Optional` [last beta](#boolean-semantics-of-optionals))

Meanwhile, non-optional types may no longer be compared to `nil`.

Source: [Xcode 6.0 Beta 6 release notes](http://ksm.github.io/SwiftInFlux/docs/beta6.pdf)

### Other changes in Xcode 6.0 Beta 6

* The `+` operator can no longer append a `Character` to `String`, clarifying that `+` is only for concatenation. (This is analogous to appending an element to an array which was [removed in Xcode 6.0 Beta 5](#other-changes))
* `Optional.hasValue` was removed
* `RawOptionSetType` (used by imported `NS_OPTIONS`) now supports bitwise assignment operators
* One-element tuples can no longer have a label. In practice, that means that an enum case that stores one value cannot have a label ([this will be fixed](#enumeration-case-value-labels)).
* Messages in `assert` calls can now use string interpolation
* New `precondition()` function. It works similarly to `assert()` (takes a condition and stops the program if it's `false`), however unlike `assert`s, `precondition`s aren't disabled in Release mode builds. (They will be stripped, however, if the application is compiled with `-Ounchecked` setting)
* Arbitrary implicit conversions between types using `__conversion() -> T` was removed. It's now only possible to add implicit conversions from value literals [using language-defined protocols](http://nshipster.com/swift-literal-convertible/).

## Changed in Xcode 6.0 Beta 5

### `dynamic` declaration modifier

`dynamic` is a new attribute that can be applied to properties, methods, subscripts and initializers to make all references to them dynamically dispatched (like message passing in Objective-C). This enables KVO, proxying, swizzling and other advanced Cocoa features to work with Swift.

Before Xcode 6.0 Beta 5, classes marked with `@objc` (or inheriting from `NSObject`) got the benefits of `dynamic` "for free", while non-`@objc` classes couldn't access dynamic dispatch at all. Now the two concepts are separate:

> This change also clarifies the `@objc` attribute. Now it only makes a declaration visible to Objective-C (for examples, to `objc_msgSend`), instead of conflating exposure to the Objective-C runtime with guaranteed lack of devirtualization. This is a cleaner conceptual semantic model that enables performance improvements for a wide range of `NSObject` subclasses by allowing the compiler to use more efficient dispatch and access techniques for declarations marked `@objc` (which is usually implicit).
>
> Though the feature is independent of the `@objc` attribute, the implementation still currently relies on Objective-C runtime details, so dynamic currently can only be applied to declarations with `@objc`-compatible types.

### Mutable optional value types

From [Xcode 6.0 Beta 5 release notes](http://ksm.github.io/SwiftInFlux/docs/beta5.pdf):

> The optional unwrapping operator x! can now be assigned through. Mutating methods and operators can be applied through it.
```swift
var x: Int! = 0
x! = 2
x!++
// Nested dictionaries can now be mutated directly:
var sequences = ["fibonacci": [1, 1, 2, 3, 0]]
sequences["fibonacci"]![4] = 5
sequences["fibonacci"]!.append(8)
```
> The ? chaining operator can also be used to conditionally assign through an optional if it has a ! value:
```swift
sequences["fibonacci"]?.append(0)
sequences["fibonacci"]?[6] = 13
sequences["perfect"]?[0] = 6 // Does nothing because the sequence has no 'perfect' key
```

Previously:

> The issue here is that optional forcing and binding operators (postfix ! and ?) return an immutable rvalue, even when the operand is a mutable lvalue.  This means that you cannot perform mutating operations on the result, which is why optional arrays, dictionaries and other value types are pretty useless right now.
> Unfortunately there isn't a great solution or workaround right now: one approach is to wrap the value in a class and use the optional on the class wrapper:
```
class StringArray {
    var elts : String[]
}
var myArray: StringArray?
```

### Nil coalescing operator

A new operator, `??`, has been introduced to help working with optionals. `??` takes an optional as its left operand, and a non-optional value or expression on the right. If the optional has a value, the whole expression evaluates to the value of the optional (the expression on the right is not evaluated). If the optional is `nil`, the right hand side expression is evaluated and passed as the result. You can think of the nil coalescing operator like the short-circuiting `||` operator, but for optionals.

For example:

```swift
var myArray: [Int] = []
print(myArray.first ?? 0) // produces 0, because myArray.first is nil
myArray.append(22)
print(myArray.first ?? 0) // produces 22, the value of myArray.first
```

### Revised attributes

Following the [changes in Xcode 6.0 Beta 4](#revised-declaration-modifiers), most of the @-attributes have been changed to declaration modifiers (shedding the `@` prefix) in Xcode 6.0 Beta 5.

### Boolean semantics of optionals

Optional values no longer conform to `BooleanType` (formerly `LogicValue`) protocol, which means that:

> (...) they may no longer be used in place of boolean expressions (they must be explicitly compared with v != nil).
>
> — Xcode 6.0 Beta 5 release notes

Before this change, the boolean semantics of optionals were confusing when the optional wrapped a value that was a `BooleanType` itself:

```swift
var foo: Bool? = false
// This would print bar
if foo {
    println("bar")
}
```

### Ranges, Intervals, Striding

Following minor changes to ranges [in Xcode 6.0 Beta 3](#range-operators) and [Xcode 6.0 Beta 4](#new-stride-functions), Xcode 6.0 Beta 5 brings a major rework of the entire area:

> The idea of a Range has been split into three separate concepts:
>
> * Ranges, which are Collections of consecutive discrete `ForwardIndexType` values. Ranges are used for slicing and iteration.
> * Intervals over `Comparable` values, which can efficiently check for containment. Intervals are used for pattern matching in switch statements and by the `~=` operator.
> * Striding over `Strideable` values, which are `Comparable` and can be advanced an arbitrary distance in O(1).
>
> Some of the types most commonly used with the range operators `..<` and `...` – for example, `Int` — conform to both Comparable and ForwardIndexType. When used in a context that requires pattern matching (such as a switch case), the range operators create _Intervals_. Otherwise they create _Ranges_. Therefore, in a context without type constraint such as `let x = 3..<10`, the result is a _Range_.
>
> It is considered an error to form a _Range_ whose `endIndex` is not reachable from its `startIndex` by incrementation, or an _Interval_ whose end is less than its start. In these cases, _Interval_ formation always traps and _Range_ formation traps when a violation is detectable, that is, when the indices are `Comparable`.
>
> ```
1> 1...0
fatal error: Can't form Range with end < start
> ```
>
> `Intervals` are represented by two generic types, `HalfOpenInterval<T>`, created by the `..<` operator, and `ClosedInterval<T>`, created by the `...` operator:
> ```
1> 3.14..<12
$R0: HalfOpenInterval<Double> = {
  _start = 3.1400000000000001
  _end = 12
}
2> 22...99.1
$R1: ClosedInterval<Double> = {
  _start = 22
  _end = 99.099999999999994
}
> ```
>
> A _range_ `x..<y` always has `startIndex == x`. Therefore, `x` is the first valid subscript, and this applies even when the `Index` type is `Int`. In other words, the first valid subscript of `5..<10` is 5, not 0. To prevent surprise, it is a compilation error to subscript a range over an Integer type outside a generic context (for example, expressions like `(5..<10)[0]`).
>
> All _Ranges_ are represented by instances of a single generic type, `Range<T>`, whose representation is always half-open (and thus always print in the REPL and Playgrounds as a half-open range). Currently an inclusive range cannot include the last value in a sequence (for example, `4...Int.max` doesn’t work) unless the context requires an _Interval_ (like a case pattern matching specification).

### Required and designated initializers in subclasses

Swift compiler now strictly enforces the presence of required initializers in subclasses. If an ancestor of a class conforms to a protocol requiring a specific initializer and the class doesn't inherit that initializer automatically, it must define it by itself.

What it means, most commonly, is that if you subclass a Cocoa class that conforms to `NSCoding` (e.g. `UIView`) and add your own designated initializer, you must also define `init(coder:)`. If you don't want to actually implement it, you can simply make it fail at runtime, like so:

```swift
required init(coder: NSCoder) {
    fatalError("Does not implement coding")
}
```

Also, the compiler now requires overrides of designated initializers to be explicitly marked with `override` and implementations of required initializers — with `required`.

### Other changes

Xcode 6.0 Beta 5 has seen a lot of symbols being renamed:

* Protocols were renamed so that they all end with `able`, `ible` or `Type`. For example, `Integer` protocol was renamed to `IntegerType`
* `LogicValue` was renamed to `BooleanType`
* `getLogicValue()` became a `boolValue` property and `Optional<T>` additionally has a `hasValue` property
* `UnsafeArray` and `UnsafeMutableArray` were renamed to `UnsafeBufferPointer` and `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer`
* `UnsafeConstPointer` and `UnsafePointer` were renamed to `UnsafePointer` and `UnsafeMutablePointer` for consistency and to encourage immutability
* `reinterpretCast()` was renamed to `unsafeBitCast()`

Other changes in the standard library:

* `+=` operator on arrays can no longer append a single item to the array (you have to wrap it into an array)
* `String` now has a constructor that takes an integer (you can even supply a radix)
* New `first`, `last` and `isEmpty` functions

Finally:

* Together with improvements in earlier betas, the Swift compiler can now produce far faster, better optimized code (on some benchmarks, Swift went from being two orders of magnitude slower than Objective-C to being an order of magnitude _faster_ than Objective-C)
* Meanwhile, Xcode can now recompile a single changed file instead of recompiling the whole project.
* You can now import frameworks in Playgrounds
* `println()` in Playgrounds now prints next to the line where it's defined (not just printed in the console output)

## Changed in Xcode 6.0 Beta 4

### Access control

Xcode 6.0 Beta 4 adds three levels of access control to user-defined entities: `public` (available anywhere), `internal` (available within the target where they're defined) and `private` (available only within the file where they're defined).

> By default, most entities in a source file have internal access. This allows application developers to largely ignore access control while allowing framework developers full control over a framework's API.

It's also possible to define attributes with public getters but private setters using the `private(set)` syntax.

It has been noted that the current access control design [makes unit testing a bit unwieldy](#limitations-of-current-access-control-design).

### Unicode string improvements

Character was changed in Xcode 6.0 Beta 4 to hold a full grapheme cluster instead of a single code point.

> Certain accented characters (like é) can be represented either as a single code point or as a sequence of two or more code points (e + ́)

Before Xcode 6.0 Beta 4, é achieved using "e" and a combining mark would be treated as two Character instances. Now, every character is a single Character. The change helps avoid a class of bugs when dealing with complex Unicode strings.

In addition to the above, Xcode 6.0 Beta 4 removes `\x`, `\u` and `\U` escape sequences for Unicode characters and replaces them with a single, less error-prone `\u{1234}` syntax

### Numerical data type conversion, e.g. CGFloat and Swift Double/Swift Float

From Xcode 6.0 Beta 4 Release Notes:
>CGFloat is now a distinct floating-point type that wraps either a Float on 32-bit architectures or a Double on 64-bit architectures.

Sources:
[Xcode 6.0 Beta 4 release notes](http://ksm.github.io/SwiftInFlux/docs/beta4.pdf)

>What is happening here is that CGFloat is a typealias for either Float or Double depending on whether you're building for 32 or 64-bits.  This is exactly how Objective-C works, but is problematic in Swift because Swift doesn't allow implicit conversions.
>
>We're aware of this problem and consider it to be serious: we are evaluating several different solutions right now and will roll one out in a later beta.  As you notice, you can cope with this today by casting to Double.  This is inelegant but effective :-)

### Revised declaration modifiers

> The @final, @lazy, @optional, and @required attributes have been converted to declaration modifiers, specified without an @ sign.

### New stride() functions

> The .by() method for ranges has been replaced with general stride() functions. To
adopt stride(), use stride(from: to: by:) for exclusive ranges and stride(from: through: by:) for inclusive ranges.

For example, you can now do:

```swift
stride(from: x, to: y, by: z)      // was: (x..<y).by(z)
stride(from: x, through: y, by: z) // was: (x...y).by(z)
```

### Set of legal operator characters

With release of Xcode 6.0 Beta 4, the full grammar of operators was specified.

https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/LexicalStructure.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH30-XID_927

> The set of characters is in flux, but yes, most unicode symbol characters in the BMP that are classified as 'symbol' and 'math' are available as operator characters.
>
> — Joe Groff

> It's not documented yet, but the set of allowed operator characters includes 'math' and 'symbol' characters in the Unicode BMP, and operator characters can be augmented with combining characters. The full set of supported characters will be documented in one of the following seeds.

### `@IBOutlet`

Before Xcode 6.0 Beta 4, marking a property with `@IBOutlet` implicitly made it a weak variable and an implicitly unwrapped optional. Now, the attribute merely makes a property visible to Interface Builder.

Previously:

> In Beta 3 (and earlier) the @IBOutlet attribute implicitly makes the variable weak, and implicitly makes it an implicitly unwrapped optional (unless it's explicitly marked with ?).  We added the 'strong' modifier in Beta 3.
>
> This is super confusing, too magic, leads to problems (like this) where "retains" are lost for types like arrays because the only reference is weak, and isn't even best practice on iOS where most outlets should be strong.  For all of these reasons, in a future Beta, @IBOutlet will become "just" an annotation for IB, without any implicit behavior.

### Fixed: Structs with both @lazy and non-lazy properties crashes compiler

structs with a @lazy property followed by a non-lazy property crashes
the compiler.

### Other changes to standard library

* `uppercaseString` and `lowercaseString` properties were removed from String
* `insertionSort` and `quickSort` were removed
* `CString` was removed. `const char *` values are now imported as `ConstUnsafePointer<Int8>`
* `modulusWithOverflow` was replaced by `remainderWithOverflow`
* `Float` and `Double` no longer conform to `RandomAccessIndex`, which means they can no longer be used to index a collection
* `true` and `false` are now language literals. `Bool` conforms to a new `BooleanLiteralConvertible` protocol that allows user-defined types to support Boolean literals.
* `ArrayBuffer`, `ArrayBufferType`, `SliceBuffer` and `ContiguousArrayBuffer` were removed (the reason being, those structures were only an implementation detail of corresponding types)
* `reverse` is no longer lazy and simply returns an Array. New `lazy` functions can be used to lazily reverse, filter and map collections through new `LazyForwardCollection`, `LazyRandomAccessCollection` and `LazySequence` structures

## Changed in Xcode 6.0 Beta 3

### Array and Dictionary type declaration syntax
Before Xcode 6.0 Beta 3, the shorthand for an Array type was `Type[]`, and Dictionary types were written `Dictionary<KeyType, ValueType>`. Array type shorthand was changed to `[Type]` and Dictionaries types now have a shorthand syntax `[KeyType: ValueType]` (e.g. `[String: Bool]`)

### Array value semantics
Since Xcode 6.0 Beta 3, Array has full value semantics to match Dictionary, String and other value types.

>Array semantics were in flux at the time of Beta 1, and have been revised to provide full value semantics like Dictionary and String.  This will be available in later betas.

### Modifying constant properties in designated vs. convenience initializers

> What is going on here is that initializers have privledged access to 'let' properties while they run: these properties are actually mutable when accessed directly within the initializer.  This is very useful when you're configurating an object during its setup, but it is absolutely required when you have an immutable property dependent on some argument to the initializer, e.g.:
>
```swift
class C {
  let x : Int   // immutable property
  init(input : Int) {
    x = input     // mutating an immutable property!
  }
}
```
> This is an important part of making immutable properties (as opposed to random other immutable variables) useful and functional, but it is dangerous, and potentially allows extensions to a type to violate invariants.
>
> Beta 3 fixes this by only allowing mutation within non-convenience initializers.  Convenience inits must delegate to some other initializer anyway, so that initializer can take an argument and do the mutation.
>
> Long story short, this is a feature, not a bug :-)

### Range operators

The half-open range operator was changed from `..` to `..<`.

> We considered this carefully.  As you can see from this thread, small syntactic issues like this are polarizing, subject to personal preferences, and have no one right answer.  See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikeshed
>
> For what it's worth, this approach is precendented in the groovy language.  It optimizes for readability and clarity: you're unlikely to mistake one operator for the other when skimming code, and new people coming to Swift are unlikely to assume that ..< is an inclusive range operator (like most assumed when they saw "0..5")
>
> — Chris Lattner
>
> I'd really like it if there was only a single range operator, but that isn't possible (AFAIK):
>
> - You need to have a half-open range operator to be able to represent an empty range.
> - You need an inclusive range operator to represent finite enumerated sequences when you want to include the last element (e.g. enums, but also integers that you want to include the largest integer value in)..
>
