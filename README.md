Swift InFlux
===========
The community is creating some incredible analyses and writing about Swift. What I keep asking myself whenever learning and reading about Swift is: how likely is this to change soon?

This document is an attempt to gather the Swift features that are still in flux and likely to change.

>Access control (public/private/etc) is coming in a later beta, this is mentioned in the Xcode release notes.

### Character

> Note that Character is still evolving and will settle down by the final release of 1.0. One of the reasons that we use double quote syntax to initialize Characters is that they are expected to be able to hold full grapheme clusters, which are composed of multiple code points. This will roll out in a later beta.

### Enumerating enum types

> > Does anyone else think this would be fundamentally useful?  Or is their a good way of apporaoching this in Swift currently that I'm missing?

### Enums nested in generic classes broken

> That's another frequently reported bug.  Unfortunately, we likely won't have time to make it work for the 1.0 release, but we intend to produce a decent compiler error message saying that it isn't supported (yet).  A workaround is to define the enums outside of generic classes.

### Flow-sensitive optional unwrapping

With this feature, optional types would be implicitly unwrapped in the context of a block checking if an optional has a value, like so:

```swift
let x: Type?

if exists x {
   x.doSomething() // works without ? or !
}
```

> We're definitely aware of the advantages of control-flow sensitive type refinement for optionals (and also for other subtype relationships).  This would be particularly handy in ternary operators, but isn't something on the books for 1.0.  We have several radars requesting that and tracking it for consideration in a future release.

### IBOutlet

> In Beta 3 (and earlier) the @IBOutlet attribute implicitly makes the variable weak, and implicitly makes it an implicitly unwrapped optional (unless it's explicitly marked with ?).  We added the 'strong' modifier in Beta 3.
>
> This is super confusing, too magic, leads to problems (like this) where "retains" are lost for types like arrays because the only reference is weak, and isn't even best practice on iOS where most outlets should be strong.  For all of these reasons, in a future Beta, @IBOutlet will become "just" an annotation for IB, without any implicit behavior.

### Mutable optional value types

> The issue here is that optional forcing and binding operators (postfix ! and ?) return an immutable rvalue, even when the operand is a mutable lvalue.  This means that you cannot perform mutating operations on the result, which is why optional arrays, dictionaries and other value types are pretty useless right now.
> Unfortunately there isn't a great solution or workaround right now: one approach is to wrap the value in a class and use the optional on the class wrapper:
```
class StringArray {
    var elts : String[]
}
var myArray: StringArray?
```
> We consider this a significant problem and are investigating various solutions to incorporate in a later Beta.

### Numerical data type conversion, e.g. CGFloat and Swift Double/Swift Float

>What is happening here is that CGFloat is a typealias for either Float or Double depending on whether you're building for 32 or 64-bits.  This is exactly how Objective-C works, but is problematic in Swift because Swift doesn't allow implicit conversions.
>
>We're aware of this problem and consider it to be serious: we are evaluating several different solutions right now and will roll one out in a later beta.  As you notice, you can cope with this today by casting to Double.  This is inelegant but effective :-)

### Optionals for values conforming to the LogicValue protocol (e.g. Bool)

Optional Bools in a boolean context are confusing.

```swift
var foo: Bool? = false
// This will print bar
if foo {
    println("bar")
}
```

>This problem exists with any optional of something that conforms to the LogicValue protocol (e.g. nested optionals, optional of bool, etc).  We consider it serious issue that needs to be fixed for 1.0 and have some ideas, but haven't settled on a solution yet.

### Ranges

> Ranges aren't in a good place in the current betas.  Among known bugs:
  - "5 ... 1" does the wrong thing.
  - "1.0 ... 2.1" produces an infinite range.
  - The "by()" method on ranges is "unprincipled" and doesn't always work
  - Subscripting a range produces the wrong results
  - Inclusive ranges including the max values "0...UInt8.max" do the wrong thing

### Reflection

> Though it’s not documented in the Swift Standard Library Reference — and is subject to change, and could disappear entirely — Swift has a reflection API.

No official word from anyone inside Apple as to whether it's gonna go public before 1.0.

### Systems Programming Features

> The focus of Swift 1.0 is definitely on improving general app development, but we do expect Swift to grow capabilities (e.g. perhaps even the ability to write inline assembly code) that allow it to fully span the gamut of programming: from writing the lowest level firmware up to the highest level application programming.  We prefer to do this carefully and deliberately over time, rather than attempting to solve all the world's problems at once.

## Changed in Beta 3

### Array and Dictionary type declaration syntax
Before Beta 3, the shorthand for an Array type was `Type[]`, and Dictionary types were written `Dictionary<KeyType, ValueType>`. Array type shorthand was changed to `[Type]` and Dictionaries types now have a shorthand syntax `[KeyType: ValueType]` (e.g. `[String: Bool]`)

### Array value semantics
Since Beta 3, Array has full value semantics to match Dictionary, String and other value types.

>Array semantics were in flux at the time of Beta 1, and have been revised to provide full value semantics like Dictionary and String.  This will be available in later betas.

### Modifying constant properties in designated vs. convenience initializers

> What is going on here is that initializers have privledged access to 'let' properties while they run: these properties are actually mutable when accessed directly within the initializer.  This is very useful when you're configurating an object during its setup, but it is absolutely required when you have an immutable property dependent on some argument to the initializer, e.g.:
>
```swift
class C {
  let x : Int   // immutable property
  init(input : Int) {
    x = input     // mutating an immutable property!
  }
}
```
> This is an important part of making immutable properties (as opposed to random other immutable variables) useful and functional, but it is dangerous, and potentially allows extensions to a type to violate invariants.
>
> Beta 3 fixes this by only allowing mutation within non-convenience initializers.  Convenience inits must delegate to some other initializer anyway, so that initializer can take an argument and do the mutation.
>
> Long story short, this is a feature, not a bug :-)

### Range operators

The half-closed range operator was changed from `..` to `..<`.

> We considered this carefully.  As you can see from this thread, small syntactic issues like this are polarizing, subject to personal preferences, and have no one right answer.  See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikeshed
>
> For what it's worth, this approach is precendented in the groovy language.  It optimizes for readability and clarity: you're unlikely to mistake one operator for the other when skimming code, and new people coming to Swift are unlikely to assume that ..< is an inclusive range operator (like most assumed when they saw "0..5")
>
>-- Chris Lattner
>
> I'd really like it if there was only a single range operator, but that isn't possible (AFAIK):
>
> - You need to have a half-open range operator to be able to represent an empty range.
> - You need an inclusive range operator to represent finite enumerated sequences when you want to include the last element (e.g. enums, but also integers that you want to include the largest integer value in)..
>
>-- Chris Lattner
